The PYROS python module offers some tools to build and evaluate recommender 
systems for implicit feedback.

### Installation with PyPi

PYROS is available in the PyPi repository and it can be installed with
```sh
pip install mkpyros
```

and then it can be imported in python with

```python
import pyros
```

### Loading a dataset

First of all you have to load the dataset. This module provides useful methods
for reading Comma Separated Values (CSV) files.

```python
from pyros.data import CSVReader
import pyros.data.dataset as ds
reader = CSVReader("path\to\the\csv\file", " ")
data = ds.UDataset(Mapping(), Mapping())
reader.read(dataset, True) #True means that the ratings are binary
```

the code above reads the content of the given CSV file (space separated) and
saves it in the dataset variable. In the example the dataset is user-centered,
that is ratings are stored as set of items rated by a user.

### Creating a recommender

Once the dataset is ready the recommender can be instanciated.
Firstly, let us import the engine module

```python
from pyros import engine es exp
```

Currently the module offers, beyond the common baselines (e.g., popularity-based),
the following recommendation algorithms:

* Matrix-based implementation of the algorithm described in 
["Efficient Top-N Recommendation for Very Large Scale Binary Rated Datasets"]
by F. Aiolli, which is based on the asymmetric cosine similarity

```python
rec = exp.I2I_Asym_Cos(data, alpha, q)
```

where 'alpha' is the asimmetric weight and 'q' the locality parameter.

* ["Convex AUC Optimization for Top-N Recommendation with Implicit Feedback"]
by F. Aiolli

```python
rec = exp.CF_OMD(data, lambda_p, lambda_n, sparse)
```

where 'lambda_p', 'lambda_n' are respectively the regularization terms for the
positives and negatives distribution, while 'sparse' is a boolean parameter that
says whether to use a sparse matrix implementation or not.

* Implementation of the algorithm (which is a simplification of CF-OMD) described in
["Kernel based collaborative filtering for very large scale top-N item recommendation"]
by M.Polato and F. Aiolli

```python
exp.ECF_OMD(data, lambda_p, sparse)
```

where the parameters has the same meaning as in CF_OMD but in this one 'lambda_n'
is not required (it is assumed to be +inf).

* Implementation of the algorithm (which is a "kernelification" of ECF-OMD) described in
["Kernel based collaborative filtering for very large scale top-N item recommendation"]
by M.Polato and F. Aiolli,
and in
["Exploiting sparsity to build efficient kernel based collaborative filtering for top-N item recommendation"]
by M.Polato and F. Aiolli.

```python
import pyros.utils as ut
K = ut.kernels.normalize(ut.kernels.linear(data.to_cvxopt_matrix()))
rec = exp.CF_KOMD(data, K, lambda_p, sparse)
```

in this case a kernel 'K' is required as parameter. The code shows an example of linear kernel
built using the support methods provided by the 'utils' module.
The 'utils' module includes also the 'kernels' submodule which contains some useful methods
related to kernels and also some kernel functions implementation as the one described in

["Disjunctive Boolean Kernels for Collaborative Filtering in Top-N Recommendation"]
by M.Polato and F. Aiolli.

* Implementation of the algorithm SLIM described in
["Sparse linear methods with side information for top-n recommendations"]
by Xia Ning and George Karypis.

```python
rec = exp.SLIM(data, beta, lbda)
```

where 'beta' and 'lbda' are the regularization of the frobenius norm and the 
Taxicab norm, respectively, as described in the paper.

* Implementation of the algorithm WRMF described in
["Collaborative Filtering for Implicit Feedback Datasets"]
by Yifan Hu, Yehuda Koren and Chris Volinsky, 
and it is also presented in ["One-Class Collaborative Filtering"]
by Rong Pan, Yunhong Zhou, Bin Cao, Nathan N. Liu, Rajan Lukose, Martin Scholz and Qiang Yang.

```python
rec = exp.WRMF(data, latent_factors, alpha, lbda, num_iters)
```

where 'latent_factors' are the number of latent features, 'alpha' is the weight value for the ratings, 
'lbda' the regularization parameter and 'num_iters' the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.

* Implementation of the algorithm BPRMF described in
["BPR: Bayesian personalized ranking from implicit feedback"]
by Steffen Rendle, Christoph Freudenthaler, Zeno Gantner and Lars Schmidt-Thieme.

```python
rec = exp.BPRMF(data, factors, learn_rate, num_iters, reg_u, reg_i, reg_bias)
```

where 'factors' are the number of latent features, 'learn_rate' is the learning rate, 
'num_iters' the maximum number of iterations of the algorithm 'reg_i', 'reg_u' and 'reg_bias'
are the regularization parameters for uesrs, items and the bias respectively.


### Training a recommender
After the instanciation of the recommender it has to be trained:

```python
rec.train(users)
```

where 'users' is the list of users for which the items ranking will
be calculated.

### Evaluating a trained recommender
Finally, the evaluation step is:

```python
import pyros.core.evaluation as ev
result = ev.evaluate(rec, data_test)
```

where 'data_test' is the test dataset which contains the ratings
to predict (unknown at training time!!).
The evaluation is done using AUC, mAP and NDCG.
